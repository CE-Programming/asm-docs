Welcome! Here you will find the nessasary tools for programming in eZ80 assembly. Be sure to follow along carefully so you can be up and ready in no time.

# Windows

Create a folder in your root drive, generally C:\, called 'CEasm'

Navigate into this folder and make another folder, this one called 'myfirstasmprgm'

Now, you are going to need an assembler. Simply put, this assembler will translate your assembly-flavored code into something that the calculator can execute. Remember, the calculator has no idea what 'code' even is, and can only do what you tell it to.

The latest version of SPASM-NG, an eZ80 assembler, can be found here: [SPASM-NG](https://github.com/alberthdev/spasm-ng/releases)

Place SPASM-NG into 'myfirstasmprgm' directory, and rename it to 'spasm.exe', if it is not already.

Now, create a new file in the 'myfirstasmprgm' directory called 'main.asm'. Be sure to watch out for extensions; Windows can sometimes save files with a .txt extension.
