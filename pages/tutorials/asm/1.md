Congradulations, you are now ready to learn some assembly! Let us begin with some common knowledge you should know.

# Numbers

Numbers are very important when working with assembly, specifically binary and hexadecimal representations. If you are a little unsure of how each representation works, [**this page**](http://www.mathsisfun.com/binary-decimal-hexadecimal.html) will guide you along. A quick refresher:

Decimal       | Hexadecimal   | Binary
------------- | ------------- | -------------
0             | 000000h       | %000000
100           | 000064h       | %1100100
200           | 0000C8h       | %11001000
255           | 0000FFh       | %11111111
500000        | 07A120h       | %1111010000100100000

Note that deciaml, binary, hexadecimal, are simply representations of the same number! There's really nothing fancy about it. However, there are some important things to note about hexadecimal and binary that will be used later:

A single binary digit is familiarly called a bit. Eight bits are called a byte. Other combinations you will hear about (Note these are eZ80-specific):

Name          | Size
------------- | -------------
nibble        | 4 bits
byte          | 8 bits
word          | 16 bits
lword         | 24 bits
