Now for the fun part. We are going to learn how to draw sprites on the screen, and rather than simply trying to manually build a sprite, we can use some prebuilt software to do it for us.

# Introduction

First, let us begin with a simple sprite such as this famialar one:
![1555 Palette]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tutorials/asm/mushroomsprite.png "+1 life!")

Notice that we want to use the pink color as a transparent color, so that we can move it over other things. This is fairly easy to do in code, as we will see later on.

Now, the question is, how do I convert this image to be used in 8bpp mode? Isn't there a palette that I have to use?
