The tutorials in this guide assume that you have a decent knowledge of eZ80 assembly. However, if you have no idea where to begin, you will first want to begin with the updated version of [**Asm in 28 Days**](http://media.taricorp.net/83pa28d/lesson/toc.html#lessons), and then introduce yourself to the small changes with the new eZ80 processor, located [**here**]({site.basurl}/tutorials/asm/ez80diff.html).

Now, on to how the format of the tutorials is structured. The end result of all these tutorials is to construct a simple game of snake, starting with the basics and working towards more advanced things. 

Inside of your *CEasm* directory that you created in the [**setup**]({site.baseurl}/setup/asmsetup.html) guide, create a new folder called *tutorial_1*. Now, inside the *tutorial_1* directory, create a file called *main.asm*.
