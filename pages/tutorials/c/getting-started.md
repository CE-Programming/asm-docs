The tutorials in this guide assume that you have a basic knowledge of C. If that is not the case, you'll be able to find C tutorials easily on Google.

[ TODO ] : rewrite that following sentence for C  
Something something copying template to new folder called tutorial_1

# Prerequisites

[ TODO ] : talk about the fact that ZDS expects ANSI C (C89), thus some common C99-syntax won't work (give examples, comparisons, etc.)  
[ TODO ] : warn about ZDS using IY and the `_OS( )` macro workaround, etc.

# The Templates

[ TODO ] : talk about the [future] multiple templates available from the toolchain folder (or will we put them in this doc repo?)  
but anyway, we'll start with a simple one here.

# Introduction
